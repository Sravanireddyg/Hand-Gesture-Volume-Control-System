# Hand Gesture Volume Control System

This project provides a touch-free way to control your computerâ€™s audio volume through hand gestures. Utilizing Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, this system tracks hand movements to adjust the volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.

## Features

- **Gesture-Based Volume Control**: Adjusts audio volume by measuring the distance between the thumb and index finger.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Captures hand movements using a webcam and updates volume instantly.
- **Volume Level Display**: Shows the current volume percentage and visual feedback on-screen.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sravanireddyg/Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control-System.git
    cd Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control-System
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the volume control system**:
    ```bash
    python VolumeControlSystem.py
    ```

2. **Using Hand Gestures to Control Volume**:
    - Position your thumb and index finger in front of the camera.
    - Adjust the distance between your thumb and index finger to increase or decrease the volume.
    - Volume level will be displayed on the screen as a percentage.

## Requirements

Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the list of dependencies. You can install them using the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
